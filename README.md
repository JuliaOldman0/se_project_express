# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. This project helps users manage their wardrobe items and determine what to wear based on the weather. You'll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with a RESTful API and user authorization.

## âœ¨ Project Functionality

- Users can:
  - View a collection of clothing items.
  - Add a new item (with name, image URL, and weather suitability).
  - Like or dislike items.
  - Delete items they own.

## ðŸ§° Technologies and Techniques Used

- **Node.js** & **Express.js** â€“ backend server and routing
- **MongoDB** & **Mongoose** â€“ database and object modeling
- **ESLint** â€“ code linting using Airbnb + Prettier config
- **REST API** â€“ standardized API structure
- **Middleware** â€“ for centralized error handling and mock authorization
- **Environment-based configuration** â€“ using `process.env`

## ðŸš€ Running the Project

```bash
npm run start     # launches the server
npm run dev       # launches the server with hot reload (via nodemon)
